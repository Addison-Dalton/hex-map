# Hex Map
This is my work done following a Unity Tutorial by the same title which can be located [here](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/part-1/).

The rational behind this tutorial is to experiment with hexagonal maps, and implement basic strategy game functionality
akin to games like Civ 5, Age of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend.
